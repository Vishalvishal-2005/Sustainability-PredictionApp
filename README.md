# 🌱 Sustainability Score Prediction System  
A Machine Learning project that predicts the sustainability score of a product or organization based on multiple environmental and operational features.

---

## 📌 **1. Problem Statement**
Sustainability has become a crucial factor for organizations and products in today’s environmentally conscious world.  
However, measuring sustainability manually is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human biases.

👉 This project aims to **predict a Sustainability Score (0–100)** using machine learning models based on key factors such as:

- Energy consumption  
- Water usage  
- Carbon emissions  
- Waste production  
- Production efficiency  
- Recycling rate  
- Environmental policy factors  

This automated scoring helps companies **improve decision-making**, **meet environmental standards**, and move towards greener operations.

## 📌 **2. Existing Technology / Limitations**
Traditional sustainability assessment relies on:

### ❌ Manual analysis  
- Time-consuming  
- Inconsistent across organizations  

### ❌ Basic reporting tools  
- Only show past data  
- No predictive capabilities  

### ❌ Lack of automation  
- Hard to scale  
- Error-prone calculations  

---

## 📌 **3. Proposed System (This Project)**
This project solves the above limitations by using **Machine Learning models** to predict a sustainability score with high accuracy.

### ✔ Automatic prediction  
### ✔ Data-driven decision making  
### ✔ Easy visualization using dashboards  
### ✔ Model comparison using multiple algorithms  
### ✔ User-friendly interface (React Frontend + FastAPI/Django backend)
